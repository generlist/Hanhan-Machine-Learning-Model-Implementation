* In the code implementation, I'm using Gini Impurity and Entropy. Entropy is slower but gives penalty heavier. In practice, Entropy is used more common.
* How to calculate Information Gain from Entropy: http://www.math.unipd.it/~aiolli/corsi/0708/IR/Lez12.pdf
* NOTE: Python may not support recursion very well, it's better to avoid to implement this code in Python....
