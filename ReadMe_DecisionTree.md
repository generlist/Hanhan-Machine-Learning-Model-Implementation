* My Decision Tree Python Implementation: https://github.com/hanhanwu/Hanhan-Machine-Learning-Model-Implementation/blob/master/my_decision_tree.py
* In the code implementation, I'm using Gini Impurity and Entropy. Entropy is slower but gives penalty heavier. In practice, Entropy is used more common.
