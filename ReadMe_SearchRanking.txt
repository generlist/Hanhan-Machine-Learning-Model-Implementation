1. get_pages.py
  * Give a set of seedpages and crawl links inside.
  * For each newly crawled links, read each of them and crawl other new links.
  * BFS (breath first search), the search layer depends on the defined depth in the code.
  * As for direct sources which can be read for reseach directly, will be collected along the way.
  * Clean urls takes time and will vary based on the seed pages. I am using wiki pages so you will see some settings can be used for wiki engligh pages only.
