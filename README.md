# Hanhan-s-Machine-Learning-Model-Implementation
Implement different type of machine learning models to deal with practical problems, majorly using Python

1. Building Price Models
  * Classifiers like Bayesian classifiers, decision trees, SVM can be used for prediction, but may not be the best choices for predictions about numerical data with many different attributes.
  * Check PriceModels_ReadMe.txt for all the details.

2. Advanced Classification for MatchMaker dataset
  * Dating website looks really magical, they match people based on the info each individual provided, the generated dataset is called MatchMaker dataset, which contains both numerical and nominal data.
  * I have practiced advanced classification models like SVM, linear classifiers and kernel methods in this part of code.
  * Finally, I have parsed friends data through Facebook Graph API, then did data preprocessing and finally used SVM to do friends prediction.
  * Check AdvancedClassification_ReadMe.txt for all the details.
